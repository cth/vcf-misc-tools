## vcf-misc-tools

This a collection of tools for use with VCF files. These are not really general purpose tools, 
but more specialized tools to itch my own scratches. For a general tool suite take a look at 
[vcf-tools](https://github.com/vcftools/vcftools)

* `_vcf-from-imputed_: Tool for converting imputed files (mach or impute2) to a VCF file. 

* _vcf-bsearch_: Tool that does fast extraction of given positions in a sorted, but not necessarily indexed VCF file. Output is another VCF file.
